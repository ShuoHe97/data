# Fuzzing java deep learning applicatios data
This repo consists of partial vggface2 and midv500 data as well as transformed(augmented, Projected Gradient Descent (PGD),  Fast Gradient Signed Method (FGSM)) data. 

[vggface2](https://github.com/ox-vgg/vgg_face2) data is used to fuzz mtcnn-java application

[midv500](https://github.com/fcakyon/midv500) data is used to fuzz Smart Cropper application.
